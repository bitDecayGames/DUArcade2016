Point and click adventure pseudo-style.

# Controls
- WASD movement
- Mouse click interactions with objects in world
	
# Environment
- Museum
  - Lots of objects, theoretically lots of interactions to happen
  - Late night, low light
	

# Phases
**Planning Phase**
- Do we want to have a planning phase? If so how, would this work?
- Would require different content:
  - People (assuming we are acting as a civilian)
  - Lighting changes (daytime vs night, lights on vs lights off)
  - Chasing this idea will drastically expand the scope of this game as it will result in much larger option branching/story elements
			
**Theft phase**
- The heart of the game.
- More true to the point and click origins.
  - Most point and clicks have a well-defined path of events.
  - Game is a game of figuring out what to do, not writing your own story.
  - In this regard, we could deal with the story as though the player is just a pawn being told what to do. Well defined missions such as "We need to steal the Chinese vase for an upcoming black market deal... blah blah blah." Where the player then has to figure out how to complete a specific task.
	
	
# Current Preference of story

# Character
- Unnamed (Let the player 'be' the character)
- Entirety of game text/story in the first person
  - "I noticed there is a button on the side of that picture frame. I wonder what it does?"
  - "As I pushed the button, the painting moved to reveal a small wooden box hidden in the wall."
		
# Gameplay
- Provided missions. Player does not choose what they want to do, but rather figure out how to do it.
- Only play in the museum at night while on the actual heist. Up to the player to find the thing they need to steal and figure out how to steal it.
- Get in, accomplish mission, leave. Next mission (Either from a phone call the player receives, or something similar)
